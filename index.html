								<p>Hello! 
								</br>
								</br>Pa here, delighted to welcome you to my little patch of the internet. 
								</br>
								</br>I'm an editor, ordained Daoist priest, and our resident shenaniganer.
								</br>
								</br>Book recommendations are my love language. It's an eternal delight of mine to hear the last book you read that left you feeling completely seen and satisfied.
								</br>
								</br>I've written eighteen novels, which have all been therapy for my soul. I keep intending to pivot to more marketable content, but I am a nonsense person, and the heart wants what it wants. 
								</br>
								</br>Surprise breadwinner for my three small children, I'm surfing the waves of these wild times, and keen to form community with kindred spirits.
								</br>
								</br>Success in writing is all about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@captainparent" target="_blank">community</a>.
								</br>
								</br>Excited to meet you, laugh unreasonably, and stay up far too late over a pot of tea to hear all your gorgeous stories.
								</br>
								</br>Happy writing,
								</br>		
								</br>Your Pa.

								<p>Hello! 
								</br>
								</br>Pa here, delighted to welcome you to my little patch of green on the internet. 
								</br>
								</br>Whatever trail of breadcrumbs or floral scent on the wind lead you here, I'm delighted you've come.
								</br>
								</br>If you're ready to dive in for the next episode of Bless, enter your information here: <a href="https://forms.gle/Z4xvvQU61Dcw75M76" target="_blank">Bless Me</a>.
								</br>
								</br>And if you've come here for deep cut information on the serial as a whole:
								</br>
								</br>Deep in a wilderness full of spooks, Sophia the widowed pregnant ex-doctor, heals family grief with her children, attracting ardent support and ominous attention from dear friends and mysterious creatures.
								</br>
								</br>For vibes, it's Gilmore Girls meets Song of the Sea.
								</br>
								</br>In a deep movie announcer voice: In a story through realms of reality... Pregnant widow Sophia protects her children, newly teen and seven, through their labyrinthian process of grief. We'll see grief journals (free therapy!), deep friendships, and cheeky supernatural beings. She's left medicine, but her family and the mysterious creatures who support and feed off her need healing. It's a Coming of Age story into womanhood, as she individuates into what she is in the wake of everything that was expected of her.
								</br>
								</br>My goal with this work was to write a feminine story in feminine voice – did I obsess over Cixous' deconstructionism, Hofstadter, and the structure of fugues? Why yes, yes I did. And why? Because I wanted to. I wanted to represent the process of pregnancy and labor more fully and truly than with ice cream and pickles, spontaneous water breakage, and one scene of screaming. To explore the awkward process of learning to love again after a lifetime promise with signed contracts and children breaks. To steep in a warm bath of friendship, love, and humor, when everything falls apart.
								</br>							
								</br>I hope you find something to love in it. It's packed to the gills with meaning, laughs, and healing, and has taught me so much.I hope you find something to love in it. It's packed to the gills with meaning, laughs, and healing, and has taught me so much.								
								</br>							
								</br>Have you read Lesser's Cassandra Speaks, or Monk Kidd's Dance of the Dissident Daughter? Through modernity, bad actors have not only suppressed the feminine voice, but actively and systematically destroyed it. We can make different choices now, if we dare. This is a long, goofy, challenging narrative—not for the faint of heart. You'll have access to it here in its raw, unpolished form. Are you ready?								
								</br>		
								</br> <a href="https://forms.gle/Z4xvvQU61Dcw75M76" target="_blank">Bless</a>.
								</br>
								</br>Happy dreaming,
								</br>		
								</br>Your Pa.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rev.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Are We a Fit?</p>
								<p>I manage urgent editorial for romance authorpreneurs, championing pleasure-based revision.
								</br>
								</br>The heck does that mean?
								</br>
								</br>I think if edits make you cry, it's worth exploring why. But more about that later.
								</br>
								</br>My whole jam is working with writers consistently and developing relationships. 
								</br>
								</br>Rapport is everything in this work. I want to know a writer's heart so I can hear their voice in the story, and make it sing.
								</br>
								</br>I work exclusively with independent authors. The pace and passion give me juice.
								</br>
								</br>My preferred rhythm with regulars is one novel a month. Under 50k gets a one week turnaround, beyond that we can work it out with rush rates up to 100k in a week. (I am a machine. Thanks, Autism!) Regular clients have access to priority scheduling.
								</br>
								</br>I'm also delighted to work with niche publishers on a case-by-case basis.
								</br>
								</br>* I specialize in they/them pronouns and neurodivergence *
								</br>
								</br>Excited to meet you, and learn the worlds you dream into being!
								</br>
								</br>Happy writing,

								<p>Writing is an isolated adventure.
								</br>
								</br>Success in writing is all about community. 
								</br>
								</br>Neurodivergence and intersectional identities can compound that heavy, gnarly feeling of being all alone in this.
								</br>
								</br>You are not alone.
								</br>
								</br>We get to grow faster, thanks to the outstretched hands from writers on the next rung up the ladder. And our need for contribution is fed when we can extend our hand to writers on the rung below.
								</br>
								</br>We're building a community here, with opportunities to give back and get a leg up that prioritize gratitude, consent, and true connection. 
								</br>
								</br>Yes, our profession necessitates deep silence and long hours braving caves of the collective psyche alone. No one can walk this path for us. 
								</br>
								</br>But, to be greeted with warmth on our return? 
								</br>
								</br>To be held with understanding and delight in the work we pour our whole selves into, time and time again?
								</br>
								</br>We get to do the hard work and laugh together. Revision can feel good.

							<h2 class="major">Services</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/kind.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>&emsp;Developmental Editing:
							</br>This service is ideal for a story either in the conception stage or final polish. If you&#8217;re looking for feedback on voice, plot, pace, character development, world building, emotional resonance, etc… you&#8217;ve come to the right place. I&#8217;ll touch on these concepts (and more, as relevant) for feedback, as well as any questions you want answered! This includes in-line comments, a "track changes" document, a clean revision document, updating series style guides, with the option to schedule live video coaching. Please include your goals for the work along with the submission, and make note of any supplemental documents available on my request (the preceding book in the series and first chapter of the following, for example).
							</br>&emsp;From 3&cent;/w, estimate two business days for every 15k words</p>
							<p>&emsp;Sensitivity Reading: 
							</br>This service is ideal for a story either in the conception stage or final polish &#8212; preferably nothing in between. For stories in the conception stage, please provide either an Inside Outline or Story Grid foolscap. For stories in their final polish, they must be publication-ready before submission to get the greatest value from the service. This generally includes in-line comments with the option to schedule live video coaching. This service will always maintain privacy and anonymity on both sides.
						</br>&emsp;From 1&cent;/w, estimate one business day for every 10k words
						</br>&emsp;Add-on to any other editing service for $600
						</br>Available Topics:
					  	</br>&emsp;Learning disabilities
						  </br>&emsp;Autism spectrum
						  </br>&emsp;ADHD
						  </br>&emsp;Dyslexia
						  </br>&emsp;Chronic illness
						  </br>&emsp;Diabetes 
						  </br>&emsp;Queer characters
					  	</br>&emsp;Asexual spectrum
						  </br>&emsp;Female characters
						  </br>&emsp;Intersectional feminism
						  </br>&emsp;Trans non-binary characters</p>  
							<p>&emsp;Line Editing: 
							</br>This service is ideal during the first stage of the writing/publishing process. Once you have a solid first draft and are ready to refine the style, pacing, logical and emotional flow, that&#8217;s where I can help! This includes in-line comments, a "track changes" document, a clean revision document, with the option to schedule live video coaching. Please include your goals for the work along with the submission, and make note of any supplemental documents available on my request (the preceding book in the series and first chapter of the following, for example).
							</br>&emsp;From 4&cent;/w, estimate one business day for every 10k words</p>
							<p>&emsp;Copy Editing: 
							</br>This service is ideal after the first few stages of the writing/publishing process. Once you have a solid first draft and have revised it to the best of your ability, it can be beneficial to get feedback from another person to make sure you&#8217;re on the right track. That&#8217;s where I come in! This includes in-line comments, a "track changes" document, and a clean revision document. Please include your goals for the work along with the submission, and make note of any supplemental documents available on my request (the preceding book in the series and first chapter of the following, for example). 
							</br>&emsp;From 2&cent;/w, estimate one business day for every 10k words</p>							
							<p>&emsp;Proofreading: 
							</br>This service is ideal for a book that&#8217;s been fully revised, sent through a few beta readers, and is now ready to be tidied up before launching it into the publishing process! In this stage, most rough mistakes should already be removed from the writing. (If the prose requires a coarser grit of sandpaper, I'm happy to offer a Copy Edit instead at no additional cost.) I&#8217;m here to give a last minute polish to grammar and spelling, and make sure nothing is out of place or missing. This includes in-line comments, a "track changes" document, and a clean revision document. Please include any necessary style sheets along with the submission.
							</br>&emsp;From 2&cent;/w, estimate one business day for every 10k words</p>
							<p>&emsp;Book Doctoring:
							</br>This collaboration provides the most bang for its buck when you have a completed draft and a clear sense of what isn&#8217;t working, with zero spoons to touch the tangle again yourself. Book doctoring is what many people imagine editors do: Take your ideas, reorganize them, rewrite them, and hand the draft back, wrapped in a silk ribbon. I do whatever it takes to make your book shine: handle the global issues, reorganize your thoughts, write transitions, add content (with consent), then polish to completion. Unlike content editing (all of the above services), where making the editorial revisions is up to you, in book doctoring, I suggest edits, then implement them myself. This can include asking you to draft b-plots or backstories that I can refine and drop into the manuscript. My job is to play doctor (steam-consensual), perform surgery where necessary, and stitch up all the seams, all in service of making your book the best it can be.
							</br>&emsp;From 6&cent;/w, estimate two business days for every 10k words</p>
							<p>&emsp;Coaching: 
							</br>This service is ideal for published authors with a regular rhythm to their work. If you&#8217;re looking for feedback on emotional resonance, voice, plot, character development, world building, craft, etc… you&#8217;ve come to the right place. I&#8217;ll touch on these concepts for feedback, as well as any questions you want answered! This includes document editing through all stages of revision (up to 100k/mo) and live video coaching (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). Packages vary, and are outlined in detail on the application <a href="https://forms.gle/YpgYXcGKyn6nJxP5A" target="_blank">form</a>. Please submit your full application <a href="https://forms.gle/YpgYXcGKyn6nJxP5A" target="_blank">form</a> before reaching out via email, and make note of any supplemental documents available on my request (the preceding book in the series and first chapter of the following, for example). <a href="https://forms.gle/YpgYXcGKyn6nJxP5A" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR THE FORM</a>.
